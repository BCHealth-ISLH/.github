# Island Health
Island Health is responsible for delivering health and care services to a large population across Vancouver Island, the islands in the Salish Sea and the Johnstone Strait, and mainland communities north of Powell River. Our dedicated family consists of a diverse team of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurse practitioners, midwives, and dentists, along with volunteers, foundations, and auxiliaries. With numerous facilities and community locations, we offer a wide range of health services, such as public health support, primary healthcare, home and community care, mental health and substance use services, and acute care in hospitals, among others, catering to the unique needs of our geographically diverse region.

### TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Before Canada and BC were formed, Indigenous peoples lived in balance and interconnectedness with the land and water in which the necessities of life are provided. Health disparities persist, which are due to the impacts of colonization and Indigenous-specific racism. Healthy lands, healthy people. Island Health acknowledges and recognizes these homelands and the stewardship of Indigenous peoples of this land; it is with humility we continue to work toward building our relationship.
